nsiconinsearch Plugin for DokuWiki

Show an icon for search results from certain namespaces

Put a png-file named icon.png (or what you define in the configuration
manager instead) in one of your first-level-namespaces, for example
icon.png in the namespace wiki. All search results which are in the
namespace wiki or in a subnamespace will get your icon near the link
in this case.
This provides an optical hint in which namespace your searchresult is.
You can also define the width and height of the icon. Please scale
large files before you put them into the folder, to avoid heavy data
traffic.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/cziehr/dokuwiki-plugin-nsiconinsearch/

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/nsiconinsearch/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
